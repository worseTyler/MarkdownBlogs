Earlier in the year, I published a couple of Whitepapers for Microsoft on the topic of using the BizTalk PeopleSoft and Siebel LOB Adapters. Since then, I have run across a few other helpful pieces of information that I thought I might share in future posts. For now, here are the links to the papers.
