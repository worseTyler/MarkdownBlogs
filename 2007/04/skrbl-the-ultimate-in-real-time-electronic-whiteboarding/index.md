I came across this some time ago and immediately took a fancy.  Tonight I needed it again for some collaboration and again I was amazed.  The figure below is my real-time collaboration with Prashant tonight.

Multiple users can "collaborate" by posting and editing content in real time onto the whiteboard.  What is most incredible about it is the fact that there is no install - none!  Nada... it appears to use Java Script entirely.

The difference between collaborating with this versus collaborating with Word is amazing.

With MS Word,

1. I type something
2. Save it
3. Email it or post it to SharePoint
4. You open it
5. turn on track changes,
6. edit it,
7. email it back... etc.

Instead, we just do Skrbl.com.  So I exaggerate slightly but you get the idea.  It is so incredibly intuitive as well.  The only thing it took me a minute or so to find was delete.

Heck... imagine pair programming with this technology.  Even my 4 Gb VSTS install can't do this nearly as easily.  :)

You GOTTA check it out.
