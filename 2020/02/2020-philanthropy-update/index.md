## We're Affecting Positive Change in Spokane, Washington!
#
This past decade, we continued giving freedom to the hopeless through our partnership with organizations that fight to eliminate poverty and injustice both locally and worldwide. We’re excited to see what this next decade will hold.

This past year, we continued to financially support the neediest in Spokane, Washington—like the women and children at [NAOMI Community](https://www.naomicommunity.org/) and the newly arrived refugee families through [Spokane World Relief](https://worldreliefspokane.org/). Refugees who settled in Spokane from Bhutan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and Somalia all benefited from job training, language skills, and citizenship classes. Because of IntelliTect’s financial partnership with Spokane World Relief, their basic needs were met.

At NAOMI Community, along with financial support for single mothers and their children, women can access counseling, attend life skills classes and attain housing. This past year, NAOMI presented Mark and Elisabeth Michaelis, founders of IntelliTect, with a Partnership Award as a result of IntelliTect’s partnership and assistance over the past decade.

This coming year, we are excited to add [Bite2Go](https://2-harvest.org/bite-2-go/) to the local organizations we help sponsor. Bite2Go provides weekly take-home meal kits to needy students in area schools who likely would go hungry without them.

In addition to IntelliTect’s sponsored giving, our community benefits from our team members’ personal time, expertise, and financial support of many different types of organizations in the Spokane area. Together, all of us make Spokane and the surrounding communities a safer, more just and more equal place to live.
