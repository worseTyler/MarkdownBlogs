### Discover how to get from an ASP.NET Core 2.1 project to the newest version of ASP.NET Core 3 in this video from the November 2019 Spokane .NET Users Group meetup.

In this talk, I uncover the basic changes required to convert an existing application from [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core 2.1 to [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core 3.1. After the initial conversion, I make additional changes so the application can take advantage of the new endpoint routing functionality and discuss what middleware changes need to be made in order for that to work.

Taking the migration one step further, I apply modifications so that new C# 8 features can be enabled, in particular, the nullability flag. This brought on some unexpected behaviors, especially around the database and its impact on migrations.

Finally, to truly make this a 3.1 application, I enabled server-side Blazor on the existing MVC application and added a simple component to show what changes needed to be made to the code so this feature would function correctly.
