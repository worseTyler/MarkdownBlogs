### Building’s History & Renovation

Built in 1930, it was originally a cooperage where wooden barrels were made. To support the weight, the floors were made of 2x6 boards turned on edge. Over the years, the space was converted into small offices and cubicles with florescent lighting, drop-ceilings, white walls and carpeted floors. The original charm was lost. Our goal was to restore it to its former glory, yet bring it into the 21st century.

During the remodel, we shoveled 4.7 tons of glass out of only half of the building. Seeing the beautiful old bones of the place, we restructured the interior to an open-plan workspace. We built fewer and larger conference rooms, some additional bathrooms and a kitchen.

It was important to us that our space felt relaxed, so we also renovated a loft and added skylights to bring in natural light. We wanted the hardwood ceiling and floors to be seen, but the rafters were covered in paint and the wood floors were coated in tar. With a lot of elbow grease scraping the floors by hand, abrasive blasting of over 20,000 square feet and the removal of 9,450 lbs of sand and paint particles, we accomplished our goal!

Throw in a bunch of toys in the basement and tech to automate our locks and lights, and we have our new home. We look forward to sharing more with you at our open house.
