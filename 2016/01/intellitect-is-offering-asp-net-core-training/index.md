## Why ASP.NET Core? _(Formally ASP.NET 5)_

ASP.NET Core is Microsoft’s next-generation, open-source, and cross-platform framework for building modern web applications.

As companies continue to realize the benefits of web applications, cloud computing, and Software as a Service, the technologies we use to build these solutions must evolve. ASP.NET Core is Microsoft’s revolutionary push to meet the diverse needs of a broad customer base.

ASP.NET Core is a significant redesign of ASP.NET. Built from the ground up, it provides an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises.

Moving to ASP.NET Core positions your team for success today and into the future.
