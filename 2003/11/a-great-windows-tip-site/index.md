I noticed a comment on my blog today that I never noticed before.  It pointed me to the JSI FAQ and I browsed around (thinking I could read all the FAQs until I realized that the one I stumbled on was number 6000 something...).  Anyway, great site!  Here are a couple tips I found useful immediately:

- How do I use Windows Server 2003 Terminal Services to connect to and shadow a console session? (This happens to be the one John mentioned in his comment to my blog entry.)
- How do I install Plus! for Windows XP on Windows Server 2003? (This lead me to search what the [command line options for msiexec.exe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/msi/setup/command_line_options.asp) were since "/?" doesn't work.)  I wonder how often "/qn" allows installs that would otherwise be disallowed?
- How do I create a custom startup WinPE CD-ROM in Windows XP?
- Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE)?
