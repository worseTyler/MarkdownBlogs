Regular keywords cannot be used anywhere within your code except from the designated positions in the specification.  For example, you cannot name a variable with a keyword (unless you use the verbatim identifier of course).  However, it is no problem to name a variable with a contextual keyword because contextual keywords don't have any significane unless they are placed in specific locations within your code.
