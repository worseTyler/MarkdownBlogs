With my last laptop I had two monitors connect by adding a PCI video card to the docking station.  The problem, however, was that the two video cards I tried prevented me from undocking the laptop even when I hibernated.  The only way I could remove the laptop was if I shut down the laptop entirely.  This was very aggravating (especially when running late for a meeting), so much so that I now just doing the single monitor thing.  [There are several ways to get dual monitor support for a laptop](https://www.realtimesoft.com/multimon/faq.asp#Laptops), however, so I decided to investigate another.

Recently I wondered if there were PCMCIA video boards that might enable the dual monitor thing.  The two cards I came across, [Appian Traveler](https://www.appian.com/products/traveler.html) (reviewed here) and [Display-to-Go](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en) (reviewed here) were also both missing any power management support so they were no better than a PCI card.

For a while the I was searching to find a half size (so that it fits in my docking station) PCI video card that supports power management.  At one point I was thinking I just had to find a PCI video card that was Windows XP certified but from what I can tell, this is an impossibility since Windows XP requires video cards to be AGP.  Stink!

Anyway, Christian Studer ([http://www.realtimesoft.com](https://www.realtimesoft.com)) points out that the real issue is that Windows doesn't support disabling a video card without rebooting the system but if this is changed in a future release of Windows, it should then be possible to undock without problems.  Any chance you could do this for me Microsoft?
