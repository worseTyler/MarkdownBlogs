Finally, there will be a search everything in Visual Studio vNext.  Here are a couple screen shots:

> [![TeamNavigatorSearchWorkItems](images/TeamNavigatorSearchWorkItems_thumb.jpg "TeamNavigatorSearchWorkItems")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TeamNavigatorSearchWorkItems.jpg)[![TeamNavigatorSearchWorkItem2](images/TeamNavigatorSearchWorkItem2_thumb.jpg "TeamNavigatorSearchWorkItem2")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TeamNavigatorSearchWorkItem2.jpg)

Notice from the second image that there is a “standard” search syntax allowing you to search specific fields within the work item.
