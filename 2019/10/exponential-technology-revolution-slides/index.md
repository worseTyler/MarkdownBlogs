I discuss the importance of "future focus" at Technorama, 2019.

Recently, I spoke at [Techorama](https://www.techorama.nl/) in the Netherlands. I took a look at the next technology revolution, its impact and what individuals and their organizations need to do to be prepared for it as well as take advantage of it.

In addition, I covered artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, IoT, biotechnology, nanotechnology, quantum computing, and more. All of which certainly come with incredible opportunity and a significant amount of ethical responsibility.
