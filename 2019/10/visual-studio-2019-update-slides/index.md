I recently gave a talk that has the answers you need.

I break down the new features of Visual Studio at Techorama, 2019.

Recently, I traveled to the Netherlands to talk about the new features of Visual Studio 2019 at [Techorama, Netherlands](https://techorama.nl) a great annual international software development conference.

In my "What's New in Visual Studio 2019" session, I explained how this yearâ€™s release continues improving the developer experience. Topics included:

- Code cleanup particularly how to leverage editorconfig files or analyzers
- Enhanced debugging
- Improved pull request workflow
- IntelliCode's AI support, particularly focusing on better IntelliSense, code analytics and focused hot spots

This session helped developers learn about the new projects that come with .NET Core 3.
