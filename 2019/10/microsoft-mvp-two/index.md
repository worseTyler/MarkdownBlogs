### What's a Microsoft MVP?

According to [mvp.microsoft.com](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/Overview), "MVPs are technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community. They are always on the 'bleeding edge' and have an unstoppable urge to get their hands on new, exciting technologies. They have very deep knowledge of Microsoft products and services, while also being able to bring together diverse platforms, products and solutions, to solve real-world problems.

MVPs make up a global community of over 4,000 technical experts and community leaders across 90 countries and are driven by their passion, community spirit, and quest for knowledge. Above all and in addition to their amazing technical abilities, MVPs are always willing to help others - that's what sets them apart."

### What's a Microsoft RD?

A Microsoft RD isn't an employee of Microsoft. According to [rd.microsoft.com](https://rd.microsoft.com/en-us/about/), the goal of the program is to provide "Microsoft leaders with the customer insights and real-world voices it needs to continue empowering developers and IT professionals with the world's most innovative and impactful tools, services, and solutions."

There are only 160 RDs around the world. Like all RDs, Mark was chosen specifically for his "proven cross-platform expertise, community leadership, and commitment to business results."
