[Brian Uptagrafft](/brian-uptagrafft/), senior software engineer at IntelliTect, recently finished a project where he used machine learning to teach computers to accurately read electric meters. The task was tricky and required a lot of data, some creative problem-solving and a multi-faceted approach. He was intrigued by the time saved on the project and decided to share his experiences and insights with the [Spokane .Net Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/Spokane-NET-User-Group/) on April 9th, 2019.

The meetup mostly focused on providing an approachable starting point into the rapidly evolving field of machine learning.
