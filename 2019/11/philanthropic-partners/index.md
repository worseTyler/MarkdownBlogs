### Are you curious about the organizations we choose to partner with in our global fight for justice?

Our efforts to understand and alleviate the problems related to poverty, injustice, educational inequality, health and sanitation depend largely on the expertise of our philanthropic partners.

Groups like World Relief, International Justice Mission, Food for the Hungry, and Compassion International have in-depth knowledge and long years of expertise in this type of work.

We meet once or twice a year with these philanthropic partners to learn more about their strategies and specific needs. We use their insights to inform IntelliTect's philanthropy strategy and giving. 

### Discovering New Partners

Recently, Mark Michaelis and I met with the executive director of [Capable.org](https://capable.org/), Sean Galaway.

Capable works to end poverty in the Gulu District of northern Uganda. According to their website, Capable's mission is to "unlock the economic potential of people living in poverty."

They accomplish their mission by offering a two-year program that provides their clients training and counseling for employment, mental health and spiritual support, as well as access to trusted financial services.

Although IntelliTect does not currently fund Capable projects, we are very interested in learning more. Its exceptional model for gathering data about the long-term effectiveness of its programs deserves exploration.

For each of their clients, Capable tracks progress toward earning a livable wage and saving enough to be able to safely invest in growing their business.

Capable's goal of helping to teach a person to fish rather than giving them a fish is vital. It aligns with our philanthropic mindset and also fits in with other projects that we invest in. Check out the [Sawla Children’s Home](/sawlachildren/) or the [fight against child slavery](/why-we-give-ijm/) in West Africa for more info.

At IntelliTect, we appreciate that Capable.org also tracks the physical and social wellbeing of the people in their program. In addition, they have criteria to measure the extent to which their clients believe they are "capable" of success without program support. This self-confidence is essential to their clients’ success.
