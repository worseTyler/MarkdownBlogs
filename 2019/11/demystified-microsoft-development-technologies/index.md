### Visual Studio 2019

### Xamarin.Forms 4.x

Discover significant improvements in functionality and features. In [this video](https://intellitect.com/xamarin-forms-4-video/), Microsoft MVP, Kevin Bost, demonstrates XAML Hot Reload, Xamarin.Forms Visual, Xamarin Shell and explains their benefits to functionality and productivity.

### .NET Core 3
