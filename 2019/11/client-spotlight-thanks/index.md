As we approach Thanksgiving at IntelliTect, we’re thankful for our new corporate headquarters and a growing IntelliTect team. We are grateful for all of our new business across the country and our ongoing clients that we’ve partnered with for years.

Often, our individual team members are appreciative for the client teams they work with on a daily basis. Here are just a few team members bragging about the clients and teams they work with:

> I really appreciate the Microsoft Azure DevOps CAT team support. Ricardo, Dylan, Paul and Mickey in particular. They are very professional and are actively engaged in improving customer practices with or without Azure DevOps.
> 
> Phil Spokas, vice president of professional services

> Collaborating and solving problems with our clients gives a sense of mind that we are making an impact on the community.

> Sean Scura, SDET

> I’m so thankful for my client’s team because I have complete trust that we will execute and support each other, over and over.
> 
> Allen Monroe, senior project manager

> Stay Alfred developers understand the development process. Josh in particular, is quick to provide what we need. As a young developer, it’s helpful to work with a client that understands that development isn’t a linear process, but rather peaks of progress followed by periods of smaller, yet continuous improvement.

> Cameron Osborn, software engineer

> The team at n2y is very genuine, affable and quick to help each other out. Victoria goes above and beyond. She’s knowledgeable, friendly and always eager to assist with anything the team needs to keep moving forward.
> 
> Brian Uptagrafft, senior software engineer

> Purcell has and continues to be, an absolute treat to work with. For the past four years, we have helped them realize their vision of a Manufacturing Execution System. Purcell’s Senior Manufacturing Engineer, Dan Woods, is the product owner and does an outstanding job providing us very specific, well thought out requirements. Dan also appreciates the complexities of enterprise software development and patiently listens and understands any technical hurdles we encounter. He often will help solve our technical problem by providing an alternative solution, or a different way of thinking of the problem.

> Chris Finlayson, senior software architect
