I am a pretty tough critique when it comes to Microsoft Software announcements (perhaps because in many cases I hear about what is happening before it goes public).  However, there are some cool Windows 7 features that I am very excited about:

- Multi-monitor Support including screen orientation, accelerator keys for projection to multiple monitors (mirror/dual), multi-monitor projection support, and multi-monitor support for remote desktop (Wahoo!)
- Mounting VHDs as a drive or (more amazing) booting from a VHD - Impressive!

1 Disappointment:  Support for mounting ISOs?
