## Learn to configure computers using PowerShell but with better syntax, less effort, and fewer errors.

When configuring remote systems using PowerShell, it often can involve lots of hands-on time settings up environments, spinning up cloud instances, and running various scripts.

### This is not the only option! You can automate PowerShell processes.

IntelliTect senior software engineer, Steve Byerly, recently finished a project within PowerShell. Steve’s team used the Desired State Configuration (DSC) platform to configure machines, environments, and processes. Using DSC allowed them to define configurations from a single source of truth, as well as deploy multiple environments.

In this video, Steve walks through what’s needed to define Infrastructure as Code to reduce the amount of hands-on time required on this type of project.
