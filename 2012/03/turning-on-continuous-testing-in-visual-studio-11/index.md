The new unit testing explorer support has a new unit test explorer has a Run dropdown for selecting which text to execute (see Figure 1).

In addition, Visual Studio 11 supports continuous testing - automatically running your tests every time you compile your code.  However, as shown in Figure 1, the option to enable continuous testing doesn't appear from the **Run** dropdown (and probably shouldn't because you are not likely to be changing the option back and forth that often).  To enable continuous testing, select the **Unit Test->Unit Test Settings->Run Tests After Build** menu as shown in Figure 2.
