[ "Tanzania Child Survival Program"Mtwivila Iringa, in south-central Tanzania, is the township of Mtwivila Iringa  with approximately 12,000 residents. More than 80% of the adults are unemployed leaving these people with little hope.    Most homes in Mtwivila Iringa are poorly insulated structures made of adobe and corrugated metal, leaving families and young children susceptible to health issues that result from inclement weather and unhygienic living conditions.  Horribly, the under-5 mortality rate in this specific community is 100 deaths per 1,000 live births.  This IntelliTect funded program supports about 50 children and 40 mothers in this village.
