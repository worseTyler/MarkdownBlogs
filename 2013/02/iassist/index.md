IntelliTect's latest project with [International Assistance Program](https://iassist.org/ "International Assistance Program") began when we heard the Sawla Children's Home in Sawla, Ghana needed a new building. Many of the children in the home were attending school for the first time and a larger home for orphans could offer more children the same opportunity. During 2012, IntelliTect and IAP joined with local Ghanaian leaders to build a new residential home on six acres that is also for agriculture. The enlarged Children's Home was completed in early 2013 and now serves over a hundred children. The agricultural land is being used to train school children in farming techniques and to provide food for the people attending the school.

[Sawla Children's Home](https://iassist.org/projects/sawla-childrens-home "IAssist Sawla, Ghana Children's Home") is one of our most exciting projects. The images below were taken as the new school and well were built in 2012. As you can see, the children of Sawla desperately need this school and are very excited to have the food, shelter, education, job training and love that this home and school will provide.  In late 2014, IntelliTect sponsored the purchase of a tractor to increase the efficiency of the farm on the school's property.  The tractor is also available for rent to other nearby farms and will increase the food production for the entire region.
