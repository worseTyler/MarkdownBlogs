On the Northside of Spokane, in the Hillyard neighborhood, [Northwest Connect](https://www.nwconnect.org/ "Northwest Connect") offers people a local food bank, non food pantry items like soap, dish soap, shampoo and other toiletries as well as summer day programs for children. Because the Hillard neighborhood has the lowest per capita income of any neighborhood in Washington state, the work of Northwest Connect is especially important.

Several members of IntelliTect's team volunteer at Northwest Connect with the non-food pantry on a regular basis. We have also provided some financial backing to Northwest Connect so they can consistently keep the services open for the people of Hillyard who need support. At the invitation of Northwest Connect, IntelliTect's Chief Technical Architect Mark Michaelis has served on the Board of Trustees for Northwest Connect. During the Christmas season of 2014, IntelliTect sponsored a Household Essentials drive benefiting Northwest Connect's "[A Hand Up](https://www.nwconnect.org/ "Northwest Connect")" program. Â We expect this to become an annual tradition and look forward to continuing our support of Northwest Connect.
