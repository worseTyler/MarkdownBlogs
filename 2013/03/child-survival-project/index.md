## Child Survival Project
#
Emmabwi, Kenya is home to approximately 5,500 residents, nearly 63% of which are under the age of 5.  Sadly, only six percent of the children in Emmabwi ever complete elementary grades at school.   The unemployment rate hovers at 60 percent, and for those who _are_ employed, the average monthly income is only $12 per family.  Often child care takes a back seat to finding work, raising food on individual subsistence farms, and caring for sick loved ones.  Many children are raised by older siblings who lack knowledge and expertise in child care.  Compassion uses this IntelliTect funded Child Survival Program to help more than 50 children and 35 Moms in this community.![Map_of_Kenya](https://intellitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Map_of_Kenya.gif "Emmabwi Kenya Child Survival Project")
