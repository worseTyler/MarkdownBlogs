Arghhhh!!!  I just lost a blog post and don't feel like re-typing what I was actually planning on posting so here's my substitute:

For several years now there has been a debate between rich UI and web UI development and undoubtedly they both have their merits and problems.  There is one particular irritation, however, that causes me to favor rich client, at least for text boxes that take more than a word or two:

> DATA LOSS!!!

That's right... we've all done this.  We type a blog entry, a bug, a complaint, an email, a web purchase etc. using the web and then POOF it's gone.  We mistakenly push the back button on our fancy mouse, we hit submit only to have an error reported (not an ASP.NET web site obviously:)), we install software and accept the restart button, we shutdown the computer to kick start the OS.... etc., regardless POOF, we loose our web page data entry without any warning to save.

Sure, we still have rich client applications crash etc. but these events occur relatively seldom.  Furthermore, rich client applications support features such as background save or they prompt you before closing a document that has not been saved.

I declare that this alone makes rich clients better.  :)

P.S.  I should mention that web sites can do something to counter the problem.  How 'bout a save button and providing a way to navigate back to continue work.  Outlook for Web Access (OWA) on Exchange 2003, for example, includes a save button for persisting the email before complete.  OWA also includes an are-you-sure button if you select to close an email without sending it.  Furthermore the browser's back button doesn't work because a new window opened to type the email.

P.P.S  I have always laughed at MS Word's background save feature because it essentially said to me, “Sorry, our development team is unable to fix all the issues that cause MS Word to crash so we are going to save files automatically to reduce the annoyance of the crashes.”  However, in recent versions the background save feature has been great when de-hibernating fails, my son hits the wrong key, etc., and it is far less a MS Word issue.
