**The Good**

There must be something good cause I am hooked.

- .NET, .NET, .NET
- Piping objects:  Jeffrey, your a genius when it comes to architecture and design.
- Defining functions on the fly (on multiple lines even).
- Aliasing... finally!
- A startup script (profile.msh).
- Searching the $env:path for msh files
- Providers!  Very nice! It seems like a Team System SCC one is in order next time I am bored.
- Support for tab
- Parameter defaults

**The Bad**

- Do we really need another language?  Surely there is a legal limit on the number of new languages that can come out of one company in 5 years especially when C# is so excellent.

**The Ugly**

Ugly is such a great word for this section.  The syntax is just plain ugly:

- Where operators (-eq, -lt, -gt, etc.).  Yuck!!!!  What the heck!  What happened to !=, ==, or even <>?
- I guess I can replace the common ones with aliases but frankly get- is verbose.
- I can see the need for a pipe command and several others but an entirely new language?  Bummer!  This is painful.
- Param (...)  - you got to be kidding?  How 'bout a function header like the rest of the languages in the 21st century?
- Using "::" to call a static function.
- Instantiating an object with "New-Object()"
- Accessing environment variables with $env:

**Recommendations:**

How 'bout getting some on the C# language team to help with refining syntax.  Those guys are amazing and their help is desperately needed.  Presumably there are really good reasons for each and every language choice that the Monad team made but this syntax smells suspicious.

Besides syntax, my biggest feature request:

1. **Intellisense!!!  :)**
2. **Intellisense :)**
3. Integration between providers (drives) and explorer
4. Batch files should be executed by cmd.exe but from within msh.exe.  There is too much legacy in batch files to throw them all out.
