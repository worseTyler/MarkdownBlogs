_Welcome to our first Employee Spotlight! Each issue will feature an employee of IntelliTect. Whether you've worked with them for years or have never met our featured employee, I hope this column will continue to introduce you to the many faces of IntelliTect._

_For this issue, we featured someone who's been with IntelliTect long enough to accidentally call it "IntelliTechture" during our interview: Brian Jones._



Somewhere in the back of Brian Jones' closet is a decade old IntelliTechture polo shirt that was embroidered by his mother. Brian was a contractor back then; attending conferences and working on Hoopfest and other various projects. He was there when IntelliTechture became IntelliTect and has been a full-time employee since 2013. Currently, Brian is the Chief Integrations Architect at IntelliTect and is under contract with Avista. Brian's most recent project at Avista was the AMI MDM deployment (see IntelliTect Today for info about this massive project).

Brian couldn't be prouder of the projects involving Hoopfest and the continued success of the integrations team at Avista. Their knowledge base and ability to be agile and nimble to other team's demands – they serve at the pleasure of multiple delivery teams – allows them to operate at a high level that Brian is proud to be a part of.

> "One of the many things that makes Brian unique is his incredible understanding of the project and business requirements, not just the technical details," said Mark Michaelis, CEO of IntelliTect. "While it is true that I don't know anyone better than Brian when it comes to BizTalk, what really makes him stand out is he knows and understands the project requirements better than anyone."

If Brian could convey one thing to future customers about IntelliTect, it would be that the value proposition that IntelliTect provides is often understated. IntelliTect resources are high-end, but we're often compared to other companies that don't generally offer the same quality of deliverables we provide at the speed we are capable of. There's a lot more packed into the dollar that you get from IntelliTect.

On a personal side, Brian considers himself a movie junkie – not an uber-nerd, but he loves movies. He can't help but watch _The Martian_ with Matt Damon whenever it's on TV. Seeing the humor that Matt's character portrays, despite being in the worst situation someone could be in, is always a lure to Brian.



Born in California, Brian moved to Spokane at the age of four. He joined the Air Force and moved to Montgomery, Alabama where he worked as a computer programmer in Air Force Communications. When his tour was up, Brian continued in his previous position with the Air Force as a private contractor. In early 2000, he formed a web-based project management company with the assistance of two partners. Eventually, Brian took another job in Birmingham, Alabama, and this is where he first began working with integrations. He returned to Spokane in 2006.

Brian and his wife, Kristin, were married in Spokane, WA in 1995. They have three boys that were all born in Alabama. Currently the boys are ages 18, 15 and 12. Brian's family spends most weekends traveling to Seattle to watch the two youngest boys compete in soccer matches on their Spokane Sounders teams. When not cheering his boys on at the sidelines, Brian is active on the field and has been since he was four years old. Currently, he plays goalkeeper for the White House Grill's team, _The Old Guys,_ and also Itron's team. Brian frequently plays in three games a night or seven games a week.

If you'd like to get to know Brian more, grab a soccer ball, head to the nearest indoor field, and wait. He'll be there soon.
