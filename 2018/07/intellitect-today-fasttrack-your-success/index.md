This past September, IntelliTect was selected by Microsoft to participate in the “DevOps FastTrack Airlift 2017” given by the Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) team. We received updates on the VSTS products as well as details behind Microsoft’s own DevOps journey. Now, we conduct Migration and Lighthouse FastTrack engagements for Microsoft to bring their knowledge and insight to our clients.

## FastTrack Migrations

In May, Phil Spokas, vice president of IntelliTect, completed a two-week Migration FastTrack for a Microsoft enterprise client in Colorado. During the engagement, he assisted in performing trial migrations and developing a plan to migrate on-premise Team Foundation Services (TFS) to the cloud-based Visual Studios Team Services (VSTS).

The client had several project collection databases exceeding one terabyte and required special techniques in the migration process. Phil assisted in tests, created a strategy for production and developed a plan so that downtime could be planned appropriately. In addition, Phil helped devise a strategy to migrate hundreds of the client’s TFS work item customizations to the cloud-version of VSTS.

“It can be confusing if you don’t live this every day,” Phil said. “At IntelliTect, our goal is to help clients set up an environment and configuration in which continuous and incremental improvement can be made.”

## Lighthouse Projects

In August, Phil will be executing a Lighthouse Project at another client site. For this engagement, he will assist the client in implementing DevOps best practices on a sample application project. The sample will teach the client how to manage a product backlog, automated unit and integration testing, continuous integration and deployment through automated builds and managed releases. At the end of the training, the project will serve as a beacon for all of the client’s future projects.
