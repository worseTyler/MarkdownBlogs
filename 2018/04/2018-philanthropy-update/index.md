 



At its core, IntelliTect is a problem-solving company. So, it makes sense that we’ve dedicated significant time toward solving some of the world’s most pressing issues relating to poverty and injustice.

Over the past decade, IntelliTect has partnered with African NGOs to build schools in war-ravaged South Sudan and bring justice to widows in Nigeria. Additionally, we’ve funded municipal wells in Tanzania, helped develop child survival programs in Kenya, supported counseling centers in Uganda and financed sanitation programs in the Kirindon region of Kenya. Our CEO and chief nerd, Mark Michaelis, has visited many of these project sites and personally seen the positive impact on the local people.

In Ghana, IntelliTect partnered with International Justice Mission to fund a program that worked with local police and courts to confront boat owners and hold them accountable for illegally using young boys as slaves. The program freed the young boys and started them on a new life, as well as, helped create an improved local justice system to send slave owners to jail.

In the Spokane area, IntelliTect has supported Naomi (formally Hearth Homes), Spokane Valley Partners, Union Gospel Mission, Vanessa Behan Crisis Nursery, and Spokane World Relief.

Currently, IntelliTect is re-evaluating our philanthropy mission and are considering taking on a long-term, large-scale project targeted toward sub-Saharan Africa.

If you have questions about IntelliTect’s philanthropy or want to contribute to it, please talk with Mark or email me at [Eric.Edmonds@IntelliTect.com](mailto:Eric.Edmonds@IntelliTect.com).
