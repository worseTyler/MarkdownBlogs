Day-to-day operations and capital projects can be a drain on any budget. Our IntelliTect engineers created a suite of products that streamline required work throughout an enterprise. The suite provides environment and process management, configuration of complex applications, and allows for the duplication of accounts.

This past February, our CEO Mark Michaelis and Grant Erickson, senior software architect, demonstrated this innovative suite of products at the 2018 Oracle Utilities User Group (OUUG) conference in New Orleans, Louisiana.



“I was excited to watch potential users realize the vast number of use cases our products would provide,” Erickson said. “It was fun to interact with so many diverse people from the utility industry.”

Additionally, the suite was featured when Avista Utilities presented during OUUG on a recently completed Meter



Data Management project.

 

“Attendees were grateful to hear about a product that addressed a need they hadn’t been able to voice and yet were encountering every day,” Michaelis said.

These products were designed to simplify the Oracle Customer Care and Billing (CC&B) and Meter Data Management (MDM) tools that are used regularly by utilities nationwide. IntelliTect engineers can configure and customize our tools to work with similar products for any industry.
